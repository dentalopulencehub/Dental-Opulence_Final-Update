  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of getting a dental bridge?",

    question: "How long does the process of getting a dental bridge take?",
    answer:
      "The process of getting a dental bridge typically involves two to three visits over a few weeks. During the first visit, the adjacent teeth are prepared, and impressions are taken.

      "What are white fillings, and how are they different from traditional fillings?",
    answer:

    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "How long do crowns and veneers last?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the procedure for getting crowns or veneers?",
    answer:
      "The procedure for getting crowns or veneers usually involves two visits. During the first visit, the tooth is prepared by removing a small amount of enamel, and an impression is taken. This impression is sent to a lab where the custom crown or veneer is made. On the second visit, the crown or veneer is bonded to the tooth, and adjustments are made for a perfect fit.",

Regular visits help maintain good oral health and prevent more serious issues from developing.",

  {
    question: "What is a root canal treatment and why is it needed?",

      "A root canal treatment is a dental procedure used to treat infection at the centre of a tooth (the pulp).

This treatment helps save the tooth and prevent the infection from spreading.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect during a root canal procedure?",
    answer:
      "During a root canal procedure, your dentist will remove the infected pulp, clean and disinfect the inside of the tooth, and then fill and seal it. The procedure is usually done under local anaesthesia to minimise discomfort. After the root canal, a crown is often placed on the tooth to restore its strength and function.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I care for my tooth after a root canal treatment?",
    answer:
      "After a root canal treatment, it is important to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly.

    answer:
      "Internal tooth whitening is a procedure used to lighten a tooth that has darkened due to internal staining, often as a result of trauma, decay, or a previous root canal treatment.

  },

  {
    question: "How is the internal tooth whitening procedure performed?",
    answer:
      "During the internal whitening procedure, a bleaching agent is placed inside the tooth. The tooth is then sealed temporarily, allowing the bleaching agent to work from within.

  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of internal tooth whitening last?",
