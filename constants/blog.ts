    content: `<h2>What Causes Bad Breath?</h2>
    <p>Bad breath, medically known as halitosis, is usually caused by bacteria that build up inside the mouth. These bacteria feed on leftover food particles, releasing unpleasant-smelling sulphur compounds.</p>

    <p><strong>Common triggers include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Poor oral hygiene</li>
      <li>Dry mouth</li>
      <li>Gum disease</li>
      <li>Smoking</li>
      <li>Certain foods such as garlic or onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Treat Bad Breath</h2>
    <p>The first step is to visit your <a href="/">local dentist</a> for a full oral health check. Your dentist can identify whether the cause is gum disease, decay, or another underlying issue.</p>

    <p><strong>Effective treatments include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular brushing and flossing</li>
      <li>Using antibacterial mouthwash</li>
      <li>Professional scale and polish</li>
      <li>Treating gum infection if present</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you wear dentures, make sure they are cleaned daily to avoid odour build-up.</p>

    <h2>Simple Daily Habits for Fresher Breath</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay hydrated to prevent dry mouth</li>
      <li>Chew sugar-free gum</li>
      <li>Avoid smoking or vaping</li>
      <li>Clean your tongue gently each morning</li>
    </ul>

    excerpt: "Discover the daily habits that harm your teeth — and how to protect your enamel with advice from trusted UK dentists.",
    content: `<h2>1. Brushing Too Hard</h2>
    <p>Many people think scrubbing harder makes teeth cleaner — but it actually wears down enamel and irritates gums. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and gentle circular motions.</p>

    <h2>2. Snacking Too Often</h2>
    <p>Frequent snacking keeps acid levels high, weakening enamel. Try to limit sugary snacks between meals and rinse your mouth with water afterwards.</p>

    <h2>3. Using Teeth as Tools</h2>
    <p>Opening bottles or tearing packets with your teeth can cause chips and fractures. Keep your smile safe — use the right tool instead!</p>

    <h2>4. Skipping Dental Appointments</h2>
    <p>Regular check-ups prevent small issues from becoming painful (and expensive) problems. <a href="https://book.do.co.uk/" target="_blank">Book your dental check-up</a> every six months.</p>

    <h2>5. Drinking Too Many Fizzy Drinks</h2>
    <p>Even "diet" drinks contain acid that erodes enamel. Stick to water or milk when possible.</p>

    excerpt: "Learn which teeth whitening treatments actually work, what's safe, and what to avoid — from qualified UK dentists.",
    content: `<h2>What Causes Tooth Discolouration?</h2>
    <p>Teeth can darken over time from coffee, tea, red wine, smoking, and ageing. Some stains are external (on the surface), while others occur deeper inside the tooth.</p>

    <h2>Professional vs. DIY Whitening</h2>
    <p>Over-the-counter kits often promise dramatic results but can damage enamel or cause sensitivity. The safest and most effective whitening comes from a <a href="/services/cosmeticTreatment/teeth-whitening">professional dentist-supervised treatment</a> using regulated whitening gels.</p>

    <h2>How Professional Whitening Works</h2>
    <p>Your dentist takes a custom mould of your teeth and provides whitening trays with safe peroxide-based gels. Results are visible within 1–2 weeks and last far longer than shop products.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Maintaining Your White Smile</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid staining drinks for 48 hours post-whitening</li>
      <li>Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste</li>
      <li>Attend <a href="/services/generalTreatment/hygienist">hygiene visits</a> regularly</li>
